# Fantasy-FIRST

An idea to run a script that generates results for certain input teams. Now, here's the bad idea part of this. We're gonna try and use a C++ script as one of the implementations.

# Installation for C++
```bash
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install make
```

## Libraries (C++)
